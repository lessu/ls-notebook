TCP through USB
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52166569/ios-tcp-ip-over-usb-with-linux-side

You can connect to a TCP socket running on your iPhone over USB using iproxy. It is part of libusbmuxd.

If you're on Linux, your best bet is to install https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist/, https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd and https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice from source.

Once your iPhone trusts your PC, you can run iproxy [device port] [PC port]. Any connection to localhost:[PC port] will then be forwarded to the [device port] running on your iOS device.


 sudo pacman -S usbmuxd

sudo pacman -S libplist
